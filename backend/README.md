# Tire Shop Learning Project - Backend

## Requirements
Regardless of your operating system for successful deployment and development,
you will need the following:
* Docker and Docker Compose
* Git

### Windows
Firstly, you need to get Docker (Docker Desktop, to be precise) and install it
following [this official guide](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/windows-install/).
As a result, you will have the necessary Docker Engine, Docker Compose, and GUI also.

Secondary, you need to get and install Git [from here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
You can install it with any options you like, but **you must include MinTTY**,
because you will need to run shell scripts later on; however, if you don't like this
terminal emulator, you can use [cygwin](https://cygwin.com/) or WSL (which
will most likely be deployed on your computer as a recommended base during the
Docker installation)

### Linux
Firstly, you need to get and install Docker Engine and Docker Compose. This step
is distribution-specific, so you should refer to the official documentation
[here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/) and [here](https://docs.docker.com/compose/). 

Secondary, you need to get and install Git. This step should not present any
difficulties; however, if problems do arise, consult the official documentation for your distro.
