# Tire Shop Learning Project - Backend

## Requirements
Regardless of your operating system for successful deployment and development,
you will need the following:
* Docker and Docker Compose
* Git

### Windows
Firstly, you need to get Docker (Docker Desktop, to be precise) and install it
following [this official guide](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/windows-install/).
As a result, you will have the necessary Docker Engine, Docker Compose, and GUI also.

Secondly, you need to download and install Git from here.
You can accept any setup options you like, but you must include MinTTY, because
you will need to run shell scripts later. If you do not like this terminal emulator,
you can use Cygwin or WSL (which will probably be installed as the recommended
backend when you set up Docker).

### Linux
Firstly, you need to get and install Docker Engine and Docker Compose. This step
is distribution-specific, so you should refer to the official documentation
[here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/) and [here](https://docs.docker.com/compose/). 

Secondly, you need to install Git.
This step should not present any difficulties; however, if problems do arise,
consult the official documentation for your distribution.
